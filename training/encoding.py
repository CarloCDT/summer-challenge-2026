"""Fixed-shape network input encoding.

The real game randomizes the board every match (height 14-20, width = round(height * 1.5), so
21x14 up to 30x20), but the network needs one fixed input shape. Every board is centered in a
BOARD_HEIGHT x BOARD_WIDTH canvas and the off-board padding is marked as inked - i.e. dead
space the agent can never build on - so a padded cell is indistinguishable from a destroyed
region as far as legality is concerned.
